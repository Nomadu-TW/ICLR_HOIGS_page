    \caption{\textbf{Decomposed scene reconstruction.}
    Visualization of individual scene components demonstrating geometric integrity in occluded regions. From left to right: human-only rendering, object-only rendering, full scene rendering, and ground truth. Each row shows a different frame from the sequence, highlighting that both human and object maintain coherent geometry even during close contact and occlusion.}
