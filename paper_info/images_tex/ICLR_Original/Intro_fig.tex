    \caption{\textbf{Comparison between our method and previous approaches.}
    This figure compares rendering results between ExAvatar (\textcolor{blue}{\cite{moon2024expressive}}), a human-centric model, and Ex4DGS (\textcolor{blue}{\cite{lee2024fully}}), which uses a single motion field for all motions. ExAvatar reconstructs only humans, while Ex4DGS fails to represent contact in interaction scenarios, producing artifacts and noise around contact regions. }
