    The proposed architecture for estimating human-object interactions, leveraging features from human body parts and object Gaussian representations. The model takes as input human part features and per-Gaussian object features, processes them through bidirectional attention mechanisms to incorporate mutual contextual information, and outputs predictions for SMPL-X parameters per body part along with offset adjustments for object Gaussian centers.}
