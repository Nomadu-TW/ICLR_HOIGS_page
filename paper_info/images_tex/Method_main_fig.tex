    \caption{\textbf{Overview of the Proposed Framework.}
    Given an input video sequence, we first extract object-specific information, which is then used to reconstruct the 3D object shape via a diffusion prior. Based on the reconstructed shape, we initialize 3D Gaussians for each keyframe and use spline-based deformation as the baseline, where time-invariant and time-varying hexplane features are employed for canonical humans and interaction modeling, respectively.The final deformation is modeled through the HOI module, which learns interactions using human features and object motion features.}
